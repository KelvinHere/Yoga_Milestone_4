## 1 - Automated Testing
 
### **Unit Tests and Coverage**
Automated testing is carried out by unit testing.  Coverage of these tests is monitored by 
using **Coverage** (`pip3 install coverage`), Coverage will create a report to show how much 
of the code is covered by the unit tests.
 
- Coverage can be run on individual apps like this `coverage run --source lessons manage.py test lessons`
    - I used the additional omit argument when testing each app to remove migrations, see below for an example
    - `coverage run --omit=*/migrations/* --source lessons manage.py test lessons`
- The report from this can be viewed with `coverage report`
- To create an in depth report with visualization of the code tested use `coverage html`
- View this in depth report by viewing the coverage created **htmlcov/index.html** by
    - starting a http server `python3 -m http.server`
    - open the server and navigate to **htmlcov/index.html**
 
### Current Coverage Reports


**Home Coverage Report**

**Lessons Coverage Report**
 
![LessonsCoverage](https://github.com/KelvinHere/Yoga_Milestone_4/blob/master/work/documents/unittests/lessons.jpg "Lessons Coverage Report")
 
 
### **Running unit tests**
Create a local deployment as explained on ['Local Deployment' section of readme.md](https://github.com/KelvinHere/Yoga_Milestone_4/blob/master/README.md#local-deployment)
 
This apps unit tests use fixtures in the **profiles app**, for these to be loaded correctly the automatic creation of user profiles must be disabled, do this in settings.py by setting `RUNNING_UNIT_TESTS` to `True`
 
- To run all the tests - `python3 manage.py test`
- To run tests on an app, ie lessons app - `python3 manage.py test lessons`
 
You can keep narrowing the tests like this, `python3 manage.py test lessons.tests.test_views.test_create_lesson` 
 
### **Unit Test Results**
![UnitTests](https://github.com/KelvinHere/Yoga_Milestone_4/blob/master/work/documents/unittests/unit_tests_run_all.jpg "Unit Tests")
 
 
### **Creating Unit Tests**
 
- Follow [Running unit tests](#running-unit-tests) to create a local deployment of the app.
- In settings.py set `RUNNING_UNIT_TESTS` to true, this will disable a view to allow fixtures to be loaded properly.
- Create your unit tests in the app you want to test, for example lessons.tests.test_mynewtests.py
- Run the tests with `python3 manage.py test` to run the full test suite, or `python3 manage.py test lessons.tests.test_mynewtest` for just the example above.

    - Checkout Success Page - Validated
    - Checkout Page - Validated
        - 1 Warning: "Empty H1", ignored as it is waiting for content from JavaScript

 
### **CSS Validation**
 
CSS was validated through [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).
 
- Live links below
    - [**base.css** - Validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fms4-yoga-kelvinhere.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fcss%2Fbase.css&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)
    - [**checkout.css** - Validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fms4-yoga-kelvinhere.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fcheckout%2Fcss%2Fcheckout.css&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)
 
### **JavaScript Validation**
 
The following files were validated through manually pasting the content into [beautifytools.com](https://beautifytools.com/javascript-validator.php) JavaScript validator (with Assume I'm Using: Jquery in options).
 
- [stripe_elements.js](https://github.com/KelvinHere/Yoga_Milestone_4/blob/master/checkout/static/checkout/js/stripe_elements.js)
- [superuser_admin_js.html](https://github.com/KelvinHere/Yoga_Milestone_4/blob/master/home/templates/home/includes/superuser_admin_js.html)
- [delete_lesson_modal.js](https://github.com/KelvinHere/Yoga_Milestone_4/blob/master/lessons/static/lessons/js/delete_lesson_modal.js)
- [lesson_buttons.js](https://github.com/KelvinHere/Yoga_Milestone_4/blob/master/lessons/static/lessons/js/lesson_buttons.js)
- [featured_lessons.js](https://github.com/KelvinHere/Yoga_Milestone_4/blob/master/home/static/home/js/featured_lessons.js)
- [form_file_changer.js](https://github.com/KelvinHere/Yoga_Milestone_4/blob/master/lessons/static/lessons/js/form_file_changer.js)
 
Errors - in featured_lessons.js: the function `toggle_featured` has the error "is defined but never used." but is used by a button in home.html to toggle the featured lessons card.
 
### **Python Validation**
 
The python code in this project was limited by using `python3 -m flake8`, this gives a list of lines that are non compliant and a link to quickly access and correct them.
Some select lines were not corrected as it would make the code harder to read or break links.
 
The following errors remain.
- \<!DOCTYPE html> missing from some html files:  These were omitted from "includes" template files, or files that extend from base, to avoid getting HTML validation errors with out of place /<!DOCTYPE>'s after the page is rendered.
- The three errors below set up signals for checkout/lessons/profile signals.py.
    - `./checkout/apps.py:8:9: F401 'checkout.signals' imported but unused`
    - `./profiles/apps.py:8:9: F401 'profiles.signals' imported but unused`
    - `./lessons/apps.py:8:9: F401 'lessons.signals' imported but unused` 
- `./checkout/webhooks.py:43:80: E501 line too long (86 > 79 characters)` Left as not to break the payment intent line.
- Below, the AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS receive a line too long warning, these are setup up in the django file by default at this length, I have left them as is, the lines in question are below, with a quote from docs.djangoproject.com.
```
AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS = [
    {
        'NAME': 'django.contrib.auth.password_validation.UserAttributeSimilarityValidator',
    },
    {
        'NAME': 'django.contrib.auth.password_validation.MinimumLengthValidator',
    },
    {
        'NAME': 'django.contrib.auth.password_validation.CommonPasswordValidator',
    },
    {
        'NAME': 'django.contrib.auth.password_validation.NumericPasswordValidator',
    },
]
 
"""
From : https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/writing-code/coding-style/
 
An exception to PEP 8 is our rules on line lengths. Don’t limit lines of 
code to 79 characters if it means the code looks significantly uglier or 
is harder to read. We allow up to 119 characters as this is the width of 
GitHub code review; anything longer requires horizontal scrolling which makes 
Review is more difficult. This check is included when you run flake8. 
Documentation, comments, and docstrings should be wrapped at 79 characters, 
even though PEP 8 suggests 72.
"""
```

## 4 - Interesting Bugs Solved
 
- **Instructor deletes lesson that is already a users basket**
- Situation - If an instructor deletes a lesson that is already in a users basket, the user will receive a 404 error whenever the basket context processor is called.  This is because the lesson no longer exists in the database, but its ID is still in the users basket.
 
- Task - Have the basket context processor handle lessons that have become invalid.
 
- Action - Use djangos built in `.exists()` method to check if a lesson in the basket is still valid, if it is not the case the lesson_id is added to a removal list to be dealt with once the basket has been iterated through.  I did this as removing elements from a list or dictionary while iterating through it is a bad idea.  Once this is done lesson_ids in the invalid lessons list are popped off the basket session.
 
    - Code Before
    ```
    for lesson_id in basket:
    lesson = get_object_or_404(Lesson, lesson_id=lesson_id)
    total += lesson.price
    product_count += 1
    basket_items.append({
        'lesson': lesson,
        'price': lesson.price,
    })
    basket_item_ids.append(lesson.lesson_id)
    ```
 
    - Code After
    ```
    for lesson_id in basket:
    # Check lesson_id is valid, remove from basket if not
    if not Lesson.objects.filter(lesson_id=lesson_id).exists():
        invalid_lessons_to_remove.append(lesson_id)
    # Add lesson to basket items
    else:
        lesson = get_object_or_404(Lesson, lesson_id=lesson_id)
        total += lesson.price
        product_count += 1
        basket_items.append({
            'lesson': lesson,
            'price': lesson.price,
        })
        basket_item_ids.append(lesson.lesson_id)
 
    # Remove any invalid lessons
    if invalid_lessons_to_remove:
        for invalid_lesson in invalid_lessons_to_remove:
            basket.pop(invalid_lesson)
        invalid_lessons_to_remove = []
    ```
 
- Result - The lesson is removed from the basket before the user can get a 404 error.

***
- **'Sort lesson by rating - high to low' feature had all non-rated lessons listed at the top**
- Situation - Code would show unrated lessons higher than rated lessons
 
- Task - Get unrated lessons to appear at the bottom of the sorted list
 
- Action - I used django's F() expression and nulls_last argument to sort null/None items to the bottom of the list, new code below
    - Code Before
    ```
    lessons = lessons.order_by(sortkey)
    ```
    - Code After
    ```
    if sort_direction == 'asc':
        lessons = lessons.order_by(F(sortkey).asc(nulls_last=True))
    else:
        lessons = lessons.order_by(F(sortkey).desc(nulls_last=True))
    ```
- Result - The lessons are now sorted correctly, though I can't append a simple tag `-` to reverse the sort direction so an if else statement is used instead
 ***

- **Anonymous users**
- Situation - A lot of features on this site require a user profile to function properly, catering to anonymous users involved a lot of code to `try:` getting the user profile with `get_object_or_404` bloating code
 
- Task - Reduce this pattern in the code by following the DRY principle
 
- Action - I created a utility in the main app directory `yoga.utils.py` that contains a function that receives a request and tries to get a profile from it or return `None`.
    - Code
    ```
    def get_profile_or_none(request):
    """ Function returns a valid UserProfile or None """
    try:
        return UserProfile.objects.get(user=request.user)
    except:
        return None
    ```
 
- Result - Any part of the app where it matters if a user is logged in or not will use a single line `get_profile_or_none(request)` to return a valid profile or a None object, reducing patterns in the code.
 ***

- **MEDIA_URL on a template no going through django's interpreter**
 
- Situation - 'Lesson modal' content reviews and lesson description are retrieved through a json response, this html string is created from a template using render to string, when being created the {{ MEDIA_URL }} is not rendered into the string, giving the wrong url to the default_profile_image.jpg
 
- Task - Get the MEDIA_URL to be correctly represented in the string
 
- Action - Just before the modal is rendered to string, a variable `MEDIA_URL_for_json = settings.MEDIA_URL` is also passed as context to the render_to_string method
 
- Result - The correct MEDIA_URL location is rendered into the string without having to hard code a location in the template.
***

- **404 error creating a 500 internal server error on deployed project**
 
- Situation - When deployed, testing for a 404 error page by giving an invalid URL.  I was receiving a 500 internal server error rather than the expected 404 error, with debugging turned off I had not enough information to figure out the problem.
 
- Task - Find out what was causing the 500 server error with debugging turned off.
 
- Action -  The django documentation on [Logging](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/logging/) gives examples of loggers, I used these to get more information on the 500 error I was getting by creating a logger and viewing the results of these logs through logging into Heroku in the console and running `heroku log -t` which would then give much more information.
```
LOGGING = {
    'version': 1,
    'disable_existing_loggers': False,
    'handlers': {
        'console': {
            'class': 'logging.StreamHandler',
        },
    },
    'loggers': {
        'django': {
            'handlers': ['console'],
             'level': os.getenv('DJANGO_LOG_LEVEL', 'DEBUG'),
        },
    },
}
```
 
- Result - Given the extra log information I was able to find the source of the 500 internal server error and correct it, the logging can now be activated by adding an environment EXTRA_LOGGING variable if needed.
***

- **No CSRF Token in static js file**
 
- Situation - When moving my lesson buttons JavaScript to a static file my Ajax POST request was giving a Forbidden error because of a missing CSRF Token as the token was initially rendered into the script by a template tag.
 
- Task - Get the CSRF Token to my JavaScript function
 
- Action - In lessons.html, just before I include the static JavaScript file I created a small script to declare the CSRF Token variable so it is available for the JavaScript in my static file.
```
<script>
        // Define csrf token for static js file below
        let csrfToken = '{{ csrf_token }}';
    </script>
```
- Result - The static file now has access to the CSRF Token again and the buttons function correctly
***

### Remaining Warning Message

A warning message that remains but does not affect the app.  When performing unit tests, the lessons.LessonReview model throws the warning below

```
RuntimeWarning: DateTimeField LessonReview.date received a naive datetime 
(2021-02-26 18:17:41.356695) while time zone support is active.
warnings.warn("DateTimeField %s received a naive datetime (%s)"
```

I have traced the warning back to a migration, with the help of [this article](https://www.debugcn.com/en/article/64389139.html), using `--verbosity 2` as an argument to the unit tests.

The solution to this problem is [here: warning-because-of-old-migration](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49341801/warning-because-of-old-migration-how-should-that-be-solved), and involves [squashing the migrations](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/migrations/#migration-squashing).
This solution will squash the selected migrations and optimize them into one, canceling out opposing migrations to give just the end result rather than going through each migration one by one.

This warning message only affects the unit tests, and since the solution has the potential to introduce deeper issues, this minor bug is marked to be removed in a future update.

## 5 - Payment Attacks
  
### **Place an order without paying**
 
- Situation: Payment system can be bypassed and orders can be completed for free
    - Steps to defeat the payment system
        - Add item to basket
        - Go to checkout page and remove the stripe card element so the submit form will be valid
        - Disable JavaScript so the form is submitted without stripe_elements.js checking that payment.intent has succeeded
        - Enjoy free lessons
 
- Task: Remove this exploit
 
- Action: After reading in the Stripe documentation you can retrieve a payment intent, I added a check in the checkout view that fetches the intent from stripe.  This intent contains `Paid: True` in its JSON to confirm the purchase.  If this does not exist the item has not been paid for and the user is redirected to the basket page with an error message.  Code below.
```
        try:
            payment_intent_id = (request.POST.get('client_secret')
                                            .split('_secret')[0])
            stripe.api_key = settings.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
            fetched_intent = stripe.PaymentIntent.retrieve(payment_intent_id, )
            paid = fetched_intent['charges']['data'][0]['paid']
        except Exception:
            messages.error(request, ("Error:  Could not confirm order with "
                                     "stripe no charges have been made."))
            return redirect(reverse('view_basket'))
```
 
- Result: Users will be unable to bypass the payment system with this exploit
